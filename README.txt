This project contains a recommendation engine that recommends items based on a products category
and on a collaborative filter that filters on items that were bought by the same segment of users.
For a better explanation of how the filter rules work, see the doc strings in the functions.

To run this file, just run the business_rules.py file,
This will, with the help of the generateDB.txt file generate tables in a postgress database to store these recommendations.
Not all the tables in this database are generated by this program, the "original" tables were generated by using the group project mongo_to_pg function.
